[00:01.00] 作曲 : Jean-Ken Johnny
[00:21.48] Hello again my hideous foe
[00:26.55] The tide is high, but I’m still low
[00:31.84] You raise that gun like you’re aiming for me babe
[00:34.92] Cut and run, we can never be free yeah
[00:37.48] There is never any goal
[00:48.98] 
[00:42.62] Hide and seek
[00:43.83] Take a peek at the skill no one can teach
[00:46.01] A dance with ideals that you know you’ll never reach
[00:48.64] Picking a random “want to be” to be “somebody”
[00:50.87] Telephoned facts and poisoned wells
[00:52.23] Ready or not now, boys and girls?
[01:08.73] 
[00:53.51] High up on your throne
[00:54.59] Riding steady through the glow
[00:55.98] Perfect sinners made of gold
[00:57.21] woh oh
[01:00.21] 
[00:58.87] People come and go
[00:59.88] Only way that you can grow
[01:01.14] Is not to give a damn at all
[01:02.47] woh oh oh oh
[01:08.47] 
[01:04.20] Feel the drive
[01:06.56] When hell’s breaking loose, come and dance with me
[01:09.53] Fever dies
[01:11.83] I am what I am and they’re out of my league
[01:14.85] Can’t catch up, but we’re still in the fight
[01:17.26] May never take the leap but I tell myself
[01:19.87] “Don’t mind”
[01:21.06] Cause I’m betting all on me
[01:34.56] 
[01:24.82] Still here burning with desire
[01:26.55] Don’t you tell me that you’re tired
[01:27.92] Are ya joking? Maybe choking
[01:29.27] While they’re stoking up the fire
[01:30.63] People say “You’ve lost your vision” but you’re seeing crystal clear
[01:33.35] I’m making my own decisions before they let me disappear
[02:01.35] 
[01:36.12] What do you want from me?
[01:37.22] Guessing we’ll never agree
[01:38.06] Believing everybody ends up drowning in their own damn entropy
[01:41.49] インターネット亡者 You're addicted like I told ya
[01:43.94] から回って空になってそうさみんな燃えてこうや
[01:54.94] 
[01:46.65] People come and go
[01:47.77] Only way that you can grow
[01:49.17] Is not to give a damn at all
[01:50.47] woh oh oh oh
[01:56.47] 
[01:52.06] Feel the drive
[01:54.55] When hell’s breaking loose, come and dance with me
[01:57.49] Fever dies
[01:59.79] I am what I am and they’re out of my league
[02:02.90] Can’t catch up, but we’re still in the fight
[02:05.27] May never take the leap but I tell myself
[02:07.76] “Don’t mind”
[02:09.03] Cause I’m betting all on me
[02:22.53] 
[02:16.28] キメまくった妄想 後にひけぬ焦燥
[02:18.83] まきちらしてわめきだしてあたりちらし暴走
[02:21.47] 何番煎じなのかわかんねー持論
[02:23.86] 後生大事にドヤ顔でかましてる愚鈍
[02:31.86] 
[02:26.78] 笑わせんな効きませんな君のそのagenda
[02:29.42] Let it be known 消えろよI will never surrender
[02:32.13] People come and go There are highs and endless lows
[02:34.46] Only way that you can grow is not to give a damn at all
[03:01.96] 
[02:47.86] Hello again my hideous foe
[02:53.18] The tide is high, but I’m not alone
[03:10.68] 
[03:01.37] Feel the drive
[03:03.87] When hell’s breaking loose, come and dance with me
[03:06.83] Fever dies
[03:09.15] I am what I am and they’re out of my league
[03:12.19] Can’t catch up, but we’re still in the fight
[03:14.60] May never take the leap but I tell myself
[03:17.17] “Don’t mind”
[03:18.40] Cause I’m betting all on me
[03:31.90] 
[03:20.62] “Don’t mind”
[03:21.24] Because I’m betting all on me
[03:35.74] 
[03:22.84] Feel the drive
[03:25.05] When hell’s breaking loose, come and dance with me
[03:28.20] Fever dies
[03:30.46] I am what I am and they’re out of my league
[03:33.48] Can’t catch up, but we’re still in the fight
[03:36.08] May never take the leap but I tell myself
[03:38.39] “Don’t mind”
[03:39.79] Cause I’m betting all on me
